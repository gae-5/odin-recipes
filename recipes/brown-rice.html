    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        This copycat Chipotle brown rice recipe is an upgrade to your conventional 
        (and, let's face it, plain) side dish of rice at dinner. Brown rice provides a nutritious, 
        fiber-packed alternative to white rice. And the cilantro and lime provide an extra dash of 
        delicious Mexican flavor.

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>

       <li> 4 cups water </li>
       <li> 2 cups brown rice </li>
