    <h1> Turkey Meat Loaf </h1>

    <h2> Description </h2>
    <p>
        For a healthier turkey meatloaf, after much trial and error I came up with this recipe. It's important to make 
        this on a jelly-roll pan (rimmed baking sheet) so the liquids can be drained off. Also, don't put the topping on 
        before the meatloaf has cooked for 30 minutes; ground turkey creates a lot of juices, so if you put the topping on 
        first it will become watery and runny
    </p>

    <h2> Ingredients </h2>
    <ul>
       <li>1 ½ pounds ground turkey</li>
       <li>¾ cup crushed buttery round crackers</li>
       <li>½ cup milk</li>
       <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
       <li>1 egg</li>
       <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
       <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
       <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
       <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
       <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
       <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>

    </ul>

    <h2> Steps </h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
       <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a jelly-roll pan.</li>
       <li>Mix ground turkey, crushed crackers, milk, onion, egg, garlic, salt, and black pepper in a bowl. Shape mixture 
        into a loaf and place on the prepared pan</li>
        <li>Mix ketchup, brown sugar, and Worcestershire sauce in a separate bowl; set aside</li>
        <li>Bake meatloaf in preheated oven for 30 minutes; remove from the oven and drain off liquids. Top meatloaf with ketchup topping</li>
        <li>Return loaf to the oven and continue baking until no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes more; 
        an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (71 degrees C)</li>
        <li>Serve and enjoy!</li>

    </ol>
